DateRange
=========

Simple plugin for parsing out date ranges from user input.


Example
=======

  DateRange.parse("2008 - 2010")

will give you Array consisting of 2 elements: [start_of_range, end_of_range].

It is pretty clever about recognizing what user wants, just check out the code
to see all the things it does.
